During this day, we see the module language and we try to find a difference
between the OOP and the module language concepts. The OOP paradigm of OCaml will
be seen during the day07 and day08.

We learn about:
* compilation unit
* interfaces
* abstract types
* modules languages structures
* modules languages signatures
* modules languages interfaces

The exercices is focused on implementations of some given interfaces and
signatures.
